* Embedded photos, banners, "Like" (Arr button), bit.ly
* Active attacker can redirect your browser. SSLStrip.

* Posting password on wall doesn't help. Rogue APs. ARP poisoning.
* WPA2 Enterprise. Hole 196.
* Wifi security has long history of problems.

# VPN
* Good, but:
* Doesn't come up right away.
* What happens when it drops?
* Bad connection, or attacker.
* Pushes problem to the other side.

* Good start but:
* Not actually everywhere (Known sites only)
* Firefox only. Doesn't help with other apps. (Other browsers, social clients)
* Talk about ForceTLS??
